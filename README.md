### EEB 201, Fall 2025

# Introduction to R for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology


## Course Description
From data analysis to visualization to simulations, coding has become essential to communicate scientific research. This course introduces students to reproducible and collaborative coding practices in the R programming language. It is specifically designed with EEB graduate students in mind, with the goal of building good coding practices for your independent data analysis needs. So, no prior coding experience is required! 

We will emphasize hands-on skill development primarily using `tidyverse` R packages, which allow you to explore data and create compelling figures. Additionally, we will implement version control using GitHub and Quarto throughout the course. Upon completion of this course, you will have a solid foundation in R programming to build upon during your graduate research.  

## Learning Outcomes
* Demonstrate best practices for coding and reproducibility in R
* Become comfortable using Quarto documents and version control in RStudio
* Import and tidy complex datasets using the `tidyverse`
* Create compelling visuals using `ggplot2`
* Write simple functions and other code to automate repeated analyses
